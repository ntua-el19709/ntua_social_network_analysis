# Analysis of Social Structure to Artificial and Realistic Network Topologies (**Community Detection**)

In this exercise we do the following:

- Study of some real networks based on the metrics used in Lab 1.
- Match each real network to a topology based on their characteristics.
- Community Detection but as a problem of network partition, using the following algorithms:
  > Spectral Clustering
  > Newman-Girvan
  > Modularity Maximization
- Assesment of the partitions based on metrics (modularity, performance).
- Assesment of the algorithms based on metrics (modularity, performance) and on time.

The exercise is implemented in Jupyter Notebook `SNA_lab2.ipynb` and the markdown text is in greek. The files used for the real networks are `email-Eu-core-department-labels.txt`, `email-Eu-core.txt`, `football.gml` and `got_s5.csv`.
