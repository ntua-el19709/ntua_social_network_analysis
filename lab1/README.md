# Study and Analysis of Complex Network Topologies

In this exercise we show the following:

- Creation and visualization of different types of Networks
- Study of network metrics
- Study of node centrality metrics
- Study of network connectivity and robustness
- Study of evolutionary change of topology from _Regular_ to _Small World_
- Analysis of some real networks

The exercise is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and the markdown text is in greek. The files used for the real networks are `got.txt` and `web-Stanford.txt`.
